# CVSS Decoder

## Objective
The CVSS Decoder project aimed to create a Python script that interprets Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) strings and outputs their component values. This project was designed to enhance the understanding of CVSS metrics and provide a tool for easily decoding these strings into human-readable descriptions, which is essential for cybersecurity professionals.

### Skills Learned
- Proficiency in Python programming for cybersecurity applications.
- Understanding of CVSS v2 and v3 metrics and their implications.
- Ability to parse and interpret standardized vulnerability scoring systems.
- Enhanced knowledge of vulnerability assessment and management.
- Development of scripting skills for automation in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Python for scripting and automation.
- Standard libraries like `re` for regular expression matching.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.
